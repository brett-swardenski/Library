# Virtual Library
Team Project for INFO-C 211

We will make a program that simulates a rental system of a library. The program will be able to:
- Manage individual books and their status (i.e. checked out, title of the book, etc.)
- Manager the users and their book(s) they have checked out
- Manage a collection of the books for easy retrieval within the system
- Manage the rental of books (transactions) of the library, including which user has rented which book
- An interface to operate the program (done within the console of an IDE)
