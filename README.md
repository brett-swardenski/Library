# Virtual Library
Team Project for INFO-C 211

We will make a program that simulates a rental system of a library. The program will be able to:
- Manage individual books and their status (i.e. checked out, title of the book, etc.)
- Manager the users and their book(s) they have checked out
- Manage a collection of the books for easy retrieval within the system
- Manage the rental of books (transactions) of the library, including which user has rented which book
- An interface to operate the program (utilizing JFrames and JDialog boxes with NetBeans' GUI editor)

  ---------- INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING THE PROGRAM  ----------


  1.) Create a new project in NetBeans named "librarySystem"
  2.) Create a new package within the source packages named "libraryManagement"
  3.) add all of the files to the libraryManagement folder, including the book-3-smaller.png file.
  4.) Run from the LibraryApp class.
